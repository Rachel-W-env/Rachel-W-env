## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Rachel-W-env/Rachel-W-env** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on learning data analysis skills in R-studio and GIS for my courses. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning environmental management as a master's student at Duke University.
